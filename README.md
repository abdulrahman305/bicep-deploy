# Azure Deployment Action

This repository offers a GitHub Action for automating the deployment and management of Azure resources using ARM Templates or Bicep files. It integrates smoothly into GitHub workflows, allowing developers to manage Azure infrastructure directly within their CI/CD pipelines.

With this action, users can:

- Deploy resources via Azure Deployments or manage environments using Deployment Stacks.
- Perform various operations like creating, validating, and previewing resource changes using the "What If" feature.

**Key Configuration Options**

- **Execution Type (`type`)**: Specifies the mode of execution, whether deploying individual resources (`deployment`) or managing full environment stacks (`deploymentStack`).
- **Operations (`operation`)**: Users can create, validate, or preview changes before deploying resources. For deployment stacks, deletion and lifecycle management are also supported.
- **Scope (`scope`)**: Defines the scope at which resources are deployed, such as tenant, management group, subscription, or resource group.
- **Template & Parameters**: Paths to the ARM or Bicep templates (`template-file`) and associated parameter files (`parameters-file`).
- **What If Analysis**: Leverage the what-if operation to preview potential changes before applying them, including options to exclude certain change types (`what-if-exclude-change-type`).
- **Unmanaged Resource Actions**: Specify actions to take on unmanaged resources (`action-on-unmanage-resources`) or entire resource groups (`action-on-unmanage-resourcegroups`), such as deleting or detaching them.

This action simplifies Azure resource management, providing flexibility through various configurations, making it suitable for automating both simple and complex infrastructure scenarios.

## Usage

### Deployment

```yaml
- name: Deployment
  uses: azure/bicep-deploy@v2
  with:
    type: deployment
    operation: create
    name: Development
    location: westus2
    scope: subscription
    subscription-id: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
    template-file: ./main.bicep
    parameters-file: ./main.bicepparam
```

See more examples in [examples/DEPLOYMENT.md](./examples/DEPLOYMENT.md).

### Deployment Stack

```yaml
- name: Deployment
  uses: azure/bicep-deploy@v2
  with:
    type: deploymentStack
    operation: create
    name: Development
    location: westus2
    scope: subscription

## Dependencies

- [Login](https://github.com/azure/login): This action is used to authenticate
  the GitHub Actions workflow with Azure Resource Manager (ARM).
- [Checkout](https://github.com/actions/checkout): This action checks out the
  repository where the workflow is running onto the GitHub Actions runner.

## Inputs

The inputs for this action provide flexibility and control for managing deployment operations and resources in Azure. By combining inputs like `type`, `operation`, and `scope`, workflows can be configured to handle a variety of scenarios, from deploying individual resources to managing comprehensive deployment stacks. Inputs such as template-file, parameters-file, and tags allow for easy customization of deployment configurations and metadata. Advanced features, including `actions-on-unmanaged-resources` and "What If" analysis, ensure deployments are predictable and secure. These options make it simple to integrate Azure resource management into CI/CD workflows.

## Outputs

The action provides outputs from the deployment operation, which can be accessed in subsequent steps of a workflow. These outputs are useful for dynamically referencing values generated during the deployment process, such as resource IDs, endpoint URLs, or other outputs defined in Bicep templates.

**Accessing Outputs**

After the deployment step has been executed, outputs can be accessed using the outputs property of the step's ID. For example, if the deployment step's ID is `deployment`, its outputs can be accessed as `${{ steps.deployment.outputs.<outputName> }}`.

```yaml
- name: Print Deployment Outputs
  run: |
    echo "intOutput: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.intOutput }}"
    echo "stringOutput: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.stringOutput }}"
```

**Defining Outputs in Bicep**

Outputs are defined in the Bicep template using the output keyword. Outputs that need to be used in the workflow must be declared in the Bicep template being deployed. For example:

```yaml
output intOutput int = 42
output stringOutput string = 'Hello, World!'
```

For detailed guidance, refer to the [Bicep Outputs](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/outputs) documentation.

**Practical Usage**

1. **Define Outputs in the Bicep Template**: Declare the outputs in the `.bicep` file as shown above.
2. **Reference Outputs in Workflow**: Use the `${{ steps.<step_id>.outputs.<output_name> }}` syntax in subsequent steps to access the values.

These outputs can then be leveraged for:

- Debugging deployment results.
- Passing values dynamically to other steps or jobs.
- Integrating deployment results into a CI/CD pipeline.
